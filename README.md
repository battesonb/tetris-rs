# tetris-rs

Yet another Tetris clone in Rust. Saw that others had used tetris as a learning opportunity. I'm still grappling with
the basics of Rust, so I decided to do the same challenge.

I used [macroquad](https://crates.io/crates/macroquad) as it's cross-platform and has an extremely simple HTML Canvas-like API.

## Demo

- [Web demo](https://battesonb.github.io/tetris-rs/)
- Native demo -- pull down the source and do a `cargo run`
